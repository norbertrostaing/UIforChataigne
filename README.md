# VLC-Chataigne-Module
VLC Control in Chataigne

This module aims to control VLC through the HTTP control interface.


## Installation

You will need to configure VLC in order to be able to control it from this module. You just need to enable HTTP control, but even that can prove tricky on some systems, especially if you don't know where to look !

Here is a nice guide on how to setup VLC for http control :

Once you're done with it, you should be able to control it from the Chataigne commands on the port 9090.
